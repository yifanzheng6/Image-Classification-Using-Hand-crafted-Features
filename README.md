# Image-Classification-Using-Hand-crafted-Features

In this report, we build hand-crafted image features
based on color, image shape, texture properties as well as
principal components analysis (PCA) for image classification.
These features are then used to train some machine learning
classification algorithm like logistic regression, support vector
machine (SVM), etc. We analyze the dataset and effective of
these features through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The
performance of each classification model is also reported.
